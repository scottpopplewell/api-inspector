## About The Project

API Inspector is a Chrome Extension, which helps you inspect all the REST API calls made by any website. Instead of using the Inspect mode of Google Chrome to manually check the REST API calls made by any website, this extension allows a ready visual access. This extension has the below features:

1. **A Ready List**: Get all the REST API calls made by any website
2. **Ready Built Splunk Queries**: For each API call, you are able to automatically see logs pertaining to the request via the request's client correlation id. 
2. **Time Taken**: Note the time taken by each REST API call
3. **Status**: See the Pending, Complete or Error status of each REST API call
4. **API Details**: Understand the request content of the REST API call
5. **Download**: Download the REST API request body content for testing or validation
6. **Search**: Have an option to search the required API from the list
